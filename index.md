### Theses 

[Multi-period Optimal Power Flow with Physics-informed Graph Neural Network](/sample_page)
Master Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2024
Designing a novel multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) model that incorporates the physics of power systems and the temporal dependencies of the power system operation. The model is based on a graph neural network (GNN) that learns the power system dynamics and the optimal power flow solution over multiple time periods. The GNN is trained on a dataset generated by a power system simulator and is used to predict the optimal power flow solution for a given power system state and time period. The model is evaluated on a synthetic power system dataset and is shown to outperform existing multi-period OPF models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

[Accuracy and Reliability of Atmospheric Correction for Optical Satellite Images](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
Semester Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2024
Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of atmospheric correction algorithms for optical satellite images. The study focuses on the performance of the algorithms under different atmospheric conditions and over different land cover types. The algorithms are compared based on their ability to remove atmospheric effects from the images and to produce accurate surface reflectance values. The study is based on a dataset of optical satellite images acquired over different regions and time periods. The results show that the accuracy and reliability of the algorithms vary depending on the atmospheric conditions and land cover types, and that no single algorithm performs best under all conditions.

[An Efficient Boundary-Respecting Streamfunction-Vorticity Solver](http://example.com/)
Bachelor Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2021
Developing an efficient boundary-respecting streamfunction-vorticity solver for the simulation of incompressible flows. The solver is based on a finite difference discretization of the vorticity transport equation and the streamfunction boundary conditions. The solver is implemented in Python and is parallelized using the MPI library. The solver is evaluated on a benchmark test case and is shown to be more accurate and computationally efficient than existing streamfunction-vorticity solvers. The solver is also applied to the simulation of a flow past a circular cylinder and is shown to produce accurate results.
