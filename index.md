[Multi-period Optimal Power Flow with Physics-informed Graph Neural Network](/pdf/MasterThesis_TomLausberg.pdf)

Master Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2024

Physics Informed Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Optimal Power Flow, Unit Commitment, Mixed-Integer Optimization

Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Torch Geometric, Gurobi 

The thesis presents a novel approach to solve the multi-period optimal power flow problem using a physics-informed graph neural network. The approach combines the strengths of physics-informed neural networks and graph neural networks to model the power system dynamics and to solve the optimal power flow problem. The graph neural network is trained on historical data to learn the power system dynamics and to predict the optimal power flow solutions for different time periods. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of power system scenarios and is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed graph neural networks for solving complex optimization problems in power systems.

[An Efficient Boundary-Respecting Streamfunction-Vorticity Solver](/pdf/An_Efficient_Boundary_Respecting_Streamfunction_Vorticity_Solver.pdf)

Bachelor Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2021

Tags: Fluid Dynamics, Discrete Exterior Calculus, Finite difference methods

Technologies: C++ / Eigen

Developing an efficient boundary-respecting streamfunction-vorticity solver for the simulation of incompressible flows. The solver is based on a finite difference discretization of the vorticity transport equation and the streamfunction boundary conditions. The solver is implemented in Python and is parallelized using the MPI library. The solver is evaluated on a benchmark test case and is shown to be more accurate and computationally efficient than existing streamfunction-vorticity solvers. The solver is also applied to the simulation of a flow past a circular cylinder and is shown to produce accurate results.

[Accuracy and Reliability of Atmospheric Correction for Optical Satellite Images](/pdf/Semester_Thesis.pdf)

Semester Thesis, ETH Zurich, 2024

Atmospheric Correction, Optical Satellite Images, Remote Sensing, Land Cover Classification

Technologies: Python, rasterio/gdal/geopandas, scikit-learn

Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of atmospheric correction algorithms for optical satellite images. The study focuses on the performance of the algorithms under different atmospheric conditions and over different land cover types. The algorithms are compared based on their ability to remove atmospheric effects from the images and to produce accurate surface reflectance values. The study is based on a dataset of optical satellite images acquired over different regions and time periods. The results show that the accuracy and reliability of the algorithms vary depending on the atmospheric conditions and land cover types, and that no single algorithm performs best under all conditions.
